            <h2 class=" text-4xl font-bold my-4">What if I miss a class?</h2>
            <p>LwL programs are generally conducted over the weekends or during summer/spring breaks so that you can
                leverage our sessions to the maximum. However, if, due to some reason, you have to miss a class, then
                you
                can send us an email regarding the same. All our sessions are recorded, and we can share the video of
                the
                session with you so you can come prepared for your next class. However, we encourage our students to
                attend
                all classes for better understanding and peer and mentor interactions.</p>


            <h2 class=" text-4xl font-bold my-4">How can I connect with the mentors?</h2>
            <p>Our mentors are here to guide you with their expertise. Hence our students are often provided with email
                ids
                of the program mentors for direct communication and queries that may arise during and/or after the
                program.
            </p>


            <h2 class=" text-4xl font-bold my-4">What is the selection process?</h2>
            <p>You will have to submit an application by clicking on the ‘Apply Now’ tab. Shortlisted students then
                undergo
                an interview round before the final cohort is selected. Each of our programs is limited to a small
                cohort of
                15-20 participants for a focused-group approach. Hence, we encourage early applications from our
                students.
            </p>


            <h2 class=" text-4xl font-bold my-4">Who awards the certificates?</h2>

                may
                also receive certifications from our partner organisations. We also award winners’ certificates and
